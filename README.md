#  🐾 WordPress Plugin Customization Expert Needed  🐾 
We are looking for an experienced WordPress/PHP developer to customize the "Certificate Verification" plugin developed by SegWitz Sdn Bhd. (GitHub: https://github.com/SegWitz/wordpress-course-certificate-verification-plugin).

The plugin currently provides an interface for administrators to enter certificate details and for end-users to verify certificates via a front-end search form.

---

## What We Need:
1. Field Customization:

o Current Field Titles (Labels): Student Name, Course, Hours Completed, Certificate No, Date Of Birth, Award Date

o New Field Titles (Labels): Name, Date of Birth, Event, Duration, Certificate No, Role, Notes, View

o Field Type Adjustments: The new "Role" and "Notes" fields should be standard text fields; the "View" field should accept a URL of the Certificate and display as a clickable word “View” on both the admin dashboard and the front-end.

o Mandatory Settings: Currently, all fields are mandatory. For the new customization, "Role", "Notes", and "View" must be optional.

o Consistency: All adjustments should be reflected in the administrator dashboard as well as on the front-end search interface and be coherent with the database (or relevant data storage) to maintain streamlined functionality.

2. Visual Customization:

o Current Display: Results are shown as a row in a table.

o New Display Requirements: Results should be presented in a column format with no visible table borders, offering a mobile-friendly layout with a clean, modern design.

o Color Adjustment: The color #f6f8fd must be removed.

---

## Delivery Requirements:

• The fully customized plugin must be delivered as a ZIP file ready for installation in a WordPress environment.

• The solution must ensure that both the field and visual customizations work seamlessly and maintain coherence across all components (admin dashboard, front-end search, and data storage).
